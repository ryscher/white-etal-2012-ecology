## White et al. 2012 Analysis

The code and data in this repository allow the analyses in White et al. 2012
([http://dx.doi.org/10.1890/11-2177.1](http://dx.doi.org/10.1890/11-2177.1)) to
be fully replicated for four of the six datasets Breeding Bird Survey, Mammal
Community Database, Forest Inventory and Analysis, and Alwyn Gentry's Tree
Transects). The other two datasets were obtained under agreements restricting
the publication of raw data, but simulation results and figures can still be
generated for these datasets.

### Setup

Requirements: Python 2.x and the following Python modules: numpy, scipy,
matplotlib, mpmath, mpl_toolkits (for figures), and mpl_toolkits.basemap (for
figures). You will also need two of our custom Python modules: METE
(https://github.com/weecology/METE) and macroecotools (at the white-etal-2012
tag; https://github.com/weecology/macroecotools). These modules can be installed
by running the following commands from the command line (with sufficient
permissions):

```sh
git clone https://github.com/weecology/METE.git
cd METE
python setup.py install
git clone https://github.com/weecology/macroecotools.git
cd macroecotools
python setup.py install
```

### Replicate analyses

The analyses can be replicated by running the following commands from the
command line.

Run all analyses and generate figures:
`python mete_sads.py ./data/ all`

Run portions of the analysis pipeline:

* Empirical analyses: `python mete_sads.py ./data/ empir`
* Simulation analyses: `python mete_sads.py ./data/ sims`
* Figures: `python mete_sads.py ./data/ figs`

On Windows `./data/` should be replaced with `.\data\` to match the relevant
path conventions.

Please note that these analyses involve both a large amount of data and a lot of
computational work and therefore take a long time to run. Expect the empirical
analysis to take up to a day, and simulations to take up to a week on an 8-core
server. Generating figures takes about one hour due to the neighborhood
calculations required for the color ramps on the observed-predicted plots.

### Data use

Data is provided in this supplement for the purposes of replication and is not
presented in such a way as to be generally useful for additional analyses. If
you wish to use these datasets for additional research they should be obtained
from relevant data providers. For BBS, MCDB, FIA, and Gentry this can be done
automatically by using the EcoData Retriever
(http://ecodataretriever.org).

The ``mete_sads_data.py`` script is intendend to allow for downloading the raw data
from the original source, importing it into MySQL and then executing the queries
we used to get the data in the ./data folder. However, it is not currently
complete. Hopefully, we'll get back to it soon. Sorry for the inconvenience.
